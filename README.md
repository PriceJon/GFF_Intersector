# Running

Currently, the easiest way to run GFF intersectory is to open "gff_intersector.R" within RStudio and "runapp". This will be fixed soon. 

Currently only GFF files are accepted along with another file containing at least chromsome, start, stop and a unique ID columns contained within the first 10 columns. 

Instructions are available whilst using the program.
